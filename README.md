# Interactive Reaction-Diffusion Models

## The Theory of Reaction-Diffusion Equations
Complex and beautiful patterns, including ones very similar to those appearing on many animals in nature, can be generated from a chemical model where two reactants are simultaneously reacting with each other and diffusing through the system. In the most common of these models, known as the <b>Grey-Scott Model</b>, the reaction scheme is 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=U %2B 2V \rightarrow V">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=V \rightarrow P,">

i.e. one molecule of reactant U and two of reactant V react to create three molecules of reactant V, and occasionally molecules of reactant V convert to the inert product P. This first reaction 'feeds' reactant U into the system, and the second reaction 'kills' molecules of reactant V, removing them from the system. The rate constants <i>f</i> and <i>k</i>, respectively, set the speed of each of these reactions.

When both reactants diffuse through the system, with diffusion rates <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r_u"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r_v">, respectively, the concentrations <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> of each reactant change with time as

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = r_u \nabla^2 u - uv^2 %2B f(1-u)">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = r_v \nabla^2 v %2B uv^2 - (f%2Bk)v.">

These partial differential equations can be solved numerically to simulate chemical systems. Varying the four rate constants &mdash; <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r_u">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r_v">, <i>f</i>, and <i>k</i> &mdash; changes the pattern generated by the system.


## Our PDE Solver
Our numerical implementation of the reaction-diffusion model can be found in the <b>evolve()</b> function in the <b>pde_solver.py</b> python script. The user can vary many components of the model, including the boundary conditions, the spatial dimensions, the length of time over which it integrates, and the discrete Laplacian kernel used to perform the spatial derivation. 

## Matplotlib Visualization
We include a premade visualization of the PDE solution using the Matplotlib.pyplot library in the <b>Basic_Plotting()</b> function in the <b>BasicPlotting.py</b> python script. The output has been specifically designed for streamlined production of figures for scientific presentation. This function directly interfaces with our PDE solver so that parameters can be set locally before figure generation. The following are examples of the output files:

This is a Grey-Scott simulation with <i>f</i> = 0.0367, <i>k</i> = 0.0649 and fixed boundary conditions.

![gif load failed](/groovy/vis/diffusionReactionSimulation_Example2.gif "Example Pattern animation")

This is a Grey-Scott simulation with <i>f</i> = 0.055, <i>k</i> = 0.062 and fixed boundary conditions.

![gif load failed](/groovy/vis/diffusionReactionSimulation_Example2_Periodic.gif "Example Pattern animation with PBC")

This is a simulation with the same parameters as above, but periodic boundary conditions imposed.
